How to use: Our app has two authentication interfaces; one is for users and the other one is for admin. Users can register by simply creating a username and password to login to our website. Afterwards, they can immediately start creating a profile page or write a blog on a topic of interest. Only the user will access to their profile page and goals page. However, all users who are registered will have access to the blogs and the news feed.

Users: A student can edit their profile and goals after they input their username and password. They can also delete their blogs. Users can leave a comment for any blog on the author’s profile page. Students will save a lot time using our App to create their Portfolio and meet their graduation requirements

In the admin interface, we are able to monitor the blogs for any material that is not appropriate. We also have the ability to ensure that every password is encrypted in a hash format when the user inserts their information into the database. Every user’s information is also authenticated when they login before any pages such as their “profile page” or "goals page" is rendered. 

Features on the app: The app is featured with creative designs and functionalities that include a login and logout button. The developers created this app using React-Redux, Node.js and PostgreSQL. 

Programs: JavaScript, CSS, Nodejs, Beekeeper, React-Redux, and PostgreSQL
